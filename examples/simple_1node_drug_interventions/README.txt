This is a simplified example version of the spatial setup that was used for Sahelian simulations such as the Ivermectin simulations for BMGF and SMC simulations in Mali for Roly Gosling.
Built by Prashanth Selvaraj (pselvaraj@idmod.org).

Prereqs:
Must have dtk-tools, dtk-tools-malaria, malaria-toolbox packages installed.
(run "python setup.py" or "python setup.py develop" for all 3 packages)

Files:
configure_sahel_intervention_system.py - vector params and other config param updates
create_serialized_file.py - Creates a burn in of 60 years to be run with run_with_intervention.py
run_with_interventions.py - Picks up serialized file stored in input and runs short simulation with desired interventions.

Description:
This is a single node setup with Sahelian seasonality reflected by the vector spline.

Note:
-The serialized file can either be generated by create_serialized_file.py or can be found
in the input directory.
